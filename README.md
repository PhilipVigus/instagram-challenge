Instagram Challenge
===================

This project is my attempt at completing the Instagram weekend challenge at Makers Academy. The challenge was to write a clone of Instagram using Ruby on Rails.

## My implementation

Given the broad nature of the challenge, my first task was to try to specify the features I wanted to implement. I wrote these in the form of user stories as specified below. It was never my intention to implement all of these within the initial time frame of the challenge (1 weekend), but I found it helpful to get a clearer understanding of what I was trying to achieve. The numbers below each story are my estimates of the time required to implement that feature, based on the scale used in planning poker.
